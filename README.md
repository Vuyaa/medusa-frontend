# Medusa frontend intership

<h2>Description</h2>

<ul> 
<li>Client side of the medusa shop built with React.js.

</li>
<li>
It took me five days at a moderate pace to complete the application and implement all the requirements.
</li>
<li>
The most challenging requirement was definitely the implementation of the medusa.js library to use all the benefits of the prebuilt backend.
</li>
<li>
The implementation I am most proud of is definitely the layout and responsiveness of the application, which in my opinion provides a good user experience according to all industry standards.

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<ul>
<li>
It contains main screen with the list of products recieved from the medusa-backend,
and the product details which could be used to forward an item into the cart.
</li>
<li>
ProductList is made to fit four different screen sizes, in such a way that the grid changes from 4-3-2-1 column
</li>
<li>
The header in the main screen contains three buttons for filtering product categories.
The buttons are also responsive by changing to a hamburger drop-down menu on a certain screen size
